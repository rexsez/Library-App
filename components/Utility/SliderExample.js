// This is basically a scale slider
// value is used to show the initial value
// minimumValue is used to decide the lowest value of the scale (the one to the far left)
// which is 0 in our case since a book can't have negative rating
// maximumValue is used to decide the highest value of the scale (the one to the far right)
// which is 5 in our case
// onSlidingComplete is a function that is activated once the slider "FINISHES" moving, meaning
// not at any point in the middle, only when it stops moving
// step is used to decide by how much the scale is able to change
// in our case it's 0.5 so the scale can start from 0, and the very next point will be 0.5 then 1 and so on
// This component is developed by the react community, check the link below for reference:
// https://github.com/miblanchard/react-native-slider
